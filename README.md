# Data Manupulation and Analysis of exposure assessment study

Three dataest were used for this analysis. The analysis was carried out to understand the data, uncover patterns and relationships between two different air pollution exposure estimates (that is exposure estimate that was capured in only outdoor microenvironment and exposure estimate that capture in both indoor and outdoor microenvironment) to draw insights that could be hidden within the datasets. 

The main aim is to assess bias in the two exposure estimates and dtermine if the bias is negligience or non-negligience.
