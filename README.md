# Data Manupulation and Analysis of exposure assessment study

Three dataest were used for this analysis. The analysis was carried out to understand the data, uncover patterns and relationships between two different air pollution exposure estimates (that is exposure estimate that was capured in only outdoor microenvironment and exposure estimate that capture in both indoor and outdoor microenvironment) to draw insights that could be hidden within the datasets. 

The main aim is to assess bias in the two exposure estimates and determine if the bias is negligience or non-negligience. ans also to revealed the degree of disparities in exposure between difference socio-economic group.


The detail detail of this study could be find in the published journal. Currently the paper is under review and I promise to post the link when it is finally published.
